        <h1>So what is this for and why?</h1>
        <p>This is honestly just a basic project to build a Flask app whose main purpose is to display webscraped data.
        </p>

        <p>I wasn't sure what to pull from each site or what kind of sites I wanted to scrape. Seeing as my current
            occupation is at a laser company, there was a thought to scrape laser prices, but unfortunately, that's not
            something readily available to the public.</p>

        <p>After much (too much) deliberation on the matter, I decided to scrape data on the top Spotify songs from
            Wikipedia.
            It's not a perfect project—if such a thing even exists—but it was a fun way to practice and a
            great learning experience.</p>
